# üìà Similarity Score Subworkflow

This subworkflow calculates and compares similarity scores between enriched gene sets and their topic summaries at different summarisation levels and sample sizes. It is designed to assess alignment between gene set enrichment results and topic model summaries.

## üîó Upstream Dependency

This subworkflow **originates from the main workflow** and consumes the following outputs:

- `data/filtered_sets/*.csv`: filtered/enriched gene sets
- `data/filtered_topics/samp_{N}/*.csv`: topic summaries at various summarisation levels

The variable `N` represents the sample size and takes values from `{25, 50, 75, 100}`.

These outputs are also used in the **Top-K folder** for downstream visualisation.
